# socket.project

This project was developed during my first semester at the College to practice socket programming and establishing a connection between server and client. 

## Description

This project creates a client, server and stablishes a connection between them. I used Socket, Printwriter and Scanner classes to read and send messages. Here is how:
- Socket class was used to create a socket to stabilish a connection between the two parties
- PrintWriter class was used to send messages through the stream
- Scanner class to read messages sent through the stream 

The printwriter and Scanner class was used instead of the socket class stream, because it is easier to implement than the socket class.
